# Web Assembly, Numeric Computing, and the Future of the Web

> Talk for [WaffleJS][wafflejs] (June, 2017).


## Abstract

WebAssembly, a new portable compilation target for the web, promises to radically change how we build web applications. In this talk, I will provide an overview of WebAssembly and its current implementation status. I will next walk through a brief step-by-step example which involves compiling low-level BLAS libraries to WebAssembly for high- performance linear algebra and numeric computation. And finally, I will show how web applications using WebAssembly can achieve near native speed, thus ushering in a whole new era of high performance applications for data analysis, graphics, and data visualization.
